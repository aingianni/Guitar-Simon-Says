I have a working guitar. What do I need to create an interactive game based around these notes.

Create two classes that represent the players health and the computers health.

A successful note match will result in the computers health going down, wheres a miss will knock down the players health.

First round the notes are visible on the buttons.

Second round the notes will dissapear from the innertext of the button.
